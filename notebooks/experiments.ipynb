        "Scaled Dot-Product Attention is a fundamental component of the Transformer architecture, designed to efficiently compute attention weights. It takes three inputs: a query matrix (Q), a key matrix (K), and a value matrix (V). The core idea is to calculate a similarity score between the queries and keys, scale these scores, and then use them to weigh the values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Description:**\n",

This scaling factor is crucial for preventing the dot products from becoming too large, especially with high `d_k` values, which can push the softmax function into regions with extremely small gradients, hindering training.\n",
        "3.  **Masking (Optional):** If a mask is provided, typically for causality (to prevent attention to future tokens in sequence generation) or padding (to ignore non-existent tokens), the masked positions are set to a very small negative number (e.g., `-inf`). This ensures that after the softmax operation, these positions will have an attention weight of approximately zero.\n",
        "4.  **Softmax:** A softmax function is applied to the scaled scores to obtain attention weights. This normalizes the scores such that they sum to 1, representing a probability distribution over the values.\n",
        "5.  **Weighted Sum:** Finally, these attention weights are multiplied by the value matrix (V). This creates a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is determined by its relevance to the query.\n",

It extends the concept of `ScaledDotProductAttention` by ensuring that during sequence generation, each token can only attend to previous tokens and itself, not future tokens. This is vital for tasks like language modeling where predicting the next word depends only on the words that have already occurred.\n",

        "    *   `self.scale`: A scaling factor `1 / sqrt(head_dim)` is calculated, which is standard for scaled dot-product attention to prevent large dot products from pushing the softmax into regions with tiny gradients.\n",
        "    *   `self.qkv_proj`: A linear projection layer that transforms the input `x` (with shape `(B, T, D)`) into Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) matrices. It outputs `3 * d_model` dimensions, which are then split into `d_model` for Q, K, and V respectively.\n",
        "    *   `self.out_proj`: Another linear projection layer that takes the concatenated output from all attention heads and projects it back to the original `d_model` dimension.\n",
        "    *   `self.causal_mask`: A lower triangular matrix (e.g., `[[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]]`) is created. This mask is used to block attention to future tokens. It's registered as a buffer, meaning it's part of the model's state but not a trainable parameter.\n",

        "### KVCache and CachedCausalSelfAttention: Optimizing Inference with KV Caching\n",
        "\n",
        "To enhance the efficiency of autoregressive decoding in Transformer models, especially during inference, Key-Value (KV) caching is employed. This technique avoids redundant re-computation of keys and values for previously processed tokens, significantly speeding up generation. The `KVCache` class manages this storage, and `CachedCausalSelfAttention` utilizes it for incremental token processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. `KVCache` Class\n",
        "\n",
        "The `KVCache` class is a simple container designed to store the keys (K) and values (V) computed during the self-attention mechanism across multiple decoding steps. This cache allows subsequent tokens to attend to the full historical context without re-calculating the K and V matrices for past tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Operational Breakdown:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`__init__(self)`**: Initializes an empty cache by setting `self.keys` and `self.values` to `None`. This state indicates that no keys or values have been stored yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`append(self, k_new: torch.Tensor, v_new: torch.Tensor)`**: This method adds new key and value tensors to the cache. It expects `k_new` and `v_new` to have the shape `(B, H, 1, Dh)`, representing the keys and values for the current token across batches and attention heads.\n",
        "    *   If the cache is empty (`self.keys` is `None`), the new keys and values become the initial content of the cache.\n",
        "    *   If the cache already contains data, `k_new` and `v_new` are concatenated with the existing `self.keys` and `self.values` along the sequence length dimension (dimension 2). This effectively appends the current token's K and V to the historical sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`reset(self)`**: Clears the cache by setting `self.keys` and `self.values` back to `None`. This is typically used to prepare the cache for a new generation sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. `CachedCausalSelfAttention` Class\n",
        "\n",
        "The `CachedCausalSelfAttention` module is a specialized version of the `CausalSelfAttention` designed for efficient token-by-token generation (inference) by leveraging the `KVCache`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Differences from `CausalSelfAttention`:**\n",
        "*   It processes input `x_t` with a sequence length `T=1` (a single token at a time).\n",
        "*   It takes a `kv_cache` object as an argument to store and retrieve past keys and values.\n",
        "*   It *implicitly* handles causality by only attending to the `k_full` and `v_full` retrieved from the cache, which by its nature only contains past and current tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Operational Breakdown (`forward` method):**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Input**: `x_t` with shape `(B, 1, D)` (a single token per batch) and `kv_cache`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Assertion**: `assert T == 1, \"Cached attention expects exactly one token\"` ensures that the module is used for incremental decoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **QKV Projections**: Similar to `CausalSelfAttention`, `x_t` is projected into query `q`, key `k`, and value `v` tensors for the *current* token.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Multi-Head Reshaping**: `q`, `k`, and `v` are reshaped to `(B, n_heads, 1, head_dim)` to prepare for multi-head attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Cache Append**: The newly computed `k` and `v` for the current token are appended to the `kv_cache` using `kv_cache.append(k, v)`. The cache now holds the keys and values for *all* tokens processed so far in the current sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Retrieve Full Cache**: The complete historical `keys` (`k_full`) and `values` (`v_full`) are retrieved from the `kv_cache`. These tensors will have shape `(B, H, T_total, Dh)`, where `T_total` is the current length of the generated sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Attention Score Calculation**: The query `q` (current token's query) is used to compute attention scores against `k_full` (all past and current keys). This ensures that the current token attends to the entire context generated so far.\n",
        "    $$\\text{scores} = (Q_{\\text{current}} K_{\\text{full}}^T) / \\sqrt{d_k}$$\n",
        "    The `scores` tensor will have shape `(B, n_heads, 1, T_total)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Softmax and Weighted Sum**: `softmax` is applied to the scores, and the resulting attention weights are multiplied by `v_full` to produce the output `out` for the current token. This `out` tensor effectively summarizes the information from `v_full` relevant to the current `q`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Merge Heads and Output Projection**: The `out` tensor is reshaped back to `(B, 1, D)` and then passed through `self.out_proj` to yield the final output for the current token.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Mathematical Intuition for Cached Self-Attention:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The core attention computation within `CachedCausalSelfAttention` can be viewed as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\text{Attention}(\\text{token}_t) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q_t \\cdot K_{\\le t}^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) \\cdot V_{\\le t} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "*   $Q_t$ is the Query vector for the current token at position $t$.\n",
        "*   $K_{\\le t}$ represents the concatenated Key matrix containing keys for all tokens from position $1$ up to $t$ (retrieved from `kv_cache.keys`).\n",
        "*   $V_{\\le t}$ represents the concatenated Value matrix containing values for all tokens from position $1$ up to $t$ (retrieved from `kv_cache.values`).\n",
        "*   $d_k$ is the `head_dim`, the dimensionality of the key vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this formulation, the causal masking that explicitly masks future tokens in `CausalSelfAttention` is implicitly handled. By only storing and using keys and values from tokens up to the current position ($K_{\\le t}$ and $V_{\\le t}$), the model naturally prevents attending to future information. The KV cache makes this process highly efficient by avoiding re-computation of $K_{\\le t}$ and $V_{\\le t}$ at each step; instead, it simply appends the new $K_t$ and $V_t$ to the existing cache."

        "**How it works:**\n",
        "1.  `sorted_probs, sorted_indices = torch.sort(probs, descending=True, dim=-1)`: Sorts the probabilities in descending order and keeps track of their original indices.\n",
        "2.  `cumulative_probs = torch.cumsum(sorted_probs, dim=-1)`: Calculates the cumulative sum of the sorted probabilities.\n",
        "3.  `mask = cumulative_probs <= p` and `mask[..., 0] = True`: Creates a boolean mask. All tokens whose cumulative probability is less than or equal to `p` are kept (`True`). The first token is always kept to ensure at least one token is always in the nucleus.\n",
        "4.  `filtered_sorted_probs = torch.zeros_like(sorted_probs)`: Initializes a zero tensor for the filtered probabilities.\n",
        "5.  `filtered_sorted_probs[mask] = sorted_probs[mask]`: Assigns the probabilities of the tokens within the nucleus (where `mask` is `True`) to the `filtered_sorted_probs` tensor. All others remain zero.\n",
        "6.  `result_probs.scatter_(dim=-1, index=sorted_indices, src=filtered_sorted_probs)`: Reconstructs the probability distribution in the original token order, placing the filtered probabilities back into their correct positions.\n",

        "\n",

        "4.  **Greedy Sampling (`temperature = 0.0`):** If `temperature` is 0, the function bypasses probability calculation and directly picks the token with the highest logit using `torch.argmax`. This results in deterministic, greedy generation.\n",
        "5.  **Temperature Scaling:** For `temperature > 0.0`, `logits` are divided by `temperature` before `softmax`. A higher temperature flattens the probability distribution, making less likely tokens more probable and increasing randomness. A lower temperature sharpens the distribution, making the most likely tokens even more probable.\n",
        "6.  **Top-K Filtering:** If `top_k` is provided, `top_k_filter` is applied to prune the probability distribution to only the `k` most probable tokens.\n",
        "7.  **Top-P Filtering:** If `top_p` is provided, `top_p_filter` is applied to select the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds `p`.\n",
        "8.  **Token Sampling:** `torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1)` samples a new token based on the (optionally filtered and temperature-scaled) probability distribution.\n",

        "\n",
        "The `LogitsProcessor` class acts as a flexible and composable layer for post-processing raw model logits before token sampling. It allows for the application of various decoding strategies like temperature scaling, Top-K filtering, Top-P (Nucleus) filtering, and repetition penalty in a modular way.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Description:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Initialization (`__init__`)**:\n",
        "    *   `self.temperature`: Controls the randomness of the sampling. A value of `1.0` means no change, `0.0` leads to greedy sampling (argmax), values `> 1.0` increase randomness, and `0.0 < value < 1.0` makes sampling more deterministic.\n",
        "    *   `self.top_k`: If set to an integer, it limits the sampling pool to the `k` tokens with the highest logits. Probabilities of other tokens are implicitly set to negative infinity.\n",
        "    *   `self.top_p`: If set to a float between 0 and 1, it implements Nucleus Sampling. It finds the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds `p`, and only samples from these tokens. Probabilities of tokens outside this set are implicitly set to negative infinity.\n",
        "    *   `self.repetition_penalty`: If set to a float `> 1.0`, it penalizes tokens that have already appeared in the `generated_tokens` sequence. This helps prevent the model from generating repetitive text.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Call Method (`__call__`)**:\n",
        "    *   Takes raw `logits` (shape `B, vocab_size`) and optionally `generated_tokens` (shape `B, T`) as input.\n",
        "    *   **0. Repetition Penalty**: If `repetition_penalty` is specified and `generated_tokens` are provided, the logits of tokens that are present in `generated_tokens` are modified. If a logit is positive, it's divided by `penalty`; if negative, it's multiplied by `penalty`. This makes previously generated tokens less likely to be chosen again.\n",
        "    *   **1. Temperature Scaling**: Divides `logits` by `self.temperature`. This step is crucial for controlling the shape of the probability distribution. Higher temperature flattens the distribution, increasing randomness.\n",
        "    *   **2. Top-K Filtering**: If `self.top_k` is specified, it identifies the `top_k` logits and sets all other logits to `float(\"-inf\")`. This effectively makes their probabilities zero after softmax.\n",
        "    *   **3. Top-P Filtering (Nucleus Sampling)**: If `self.top_p` is specified, it sorts the logits, calculates cumulative probabilities, and identifies the smallest set of tokens that make up `self.top_p` of the probability mass. Logits outside this set are then set to `float(\"-inf\")`.\n",
        "    *   **Returns**: The processed `logits` with modifications from repetition penalty, temperature, Top-K, and Top-P applied. These modified logits can then be passed to a softmax function and subsequently to a sampling mechanism (like `torch.multinomial`).\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works (Detailed):**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Repetition Penalty**: Directly manipulates the raw logits. A higher penalty value more strongly discourages repetition.\n",
        "*   **Temperature**: Directly scales the logits. Higher temperature makes the `softmax` distribution flatter, increasing the probability of less likely tokens. Lower temperature makes it sharper.\n",
        "*   **Top-K**: A hard cutoff. Only the `k` highest logits are considered. This helps prevent very unlikely tokens from being sampled.\n",
        "*   **Top-P**: A dynamic cutoff. It ensures that the model samples from a diverse yet probable set of tokens. It adapts to the shape of the probability distribution for each prediction step."

        "2.  **Forward Pass**: `model.forward_step(x[:, -1:])` generates raw logits for the next token based on the model's current state.\n",
        "3.  **Processing Logits**: `logits = processor(logits, generated_tokens=x)` applies all the configured processing steps (temperature, top-k, top-p, and repetition penalty based on `x`) to the raw logits.\n",
        "4.  **Sampling**: `torch.multinomial(torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1), num_samples=1)` samples a `next_token` from the processed probability distribution.\n",

        "\n",
        "This section explicitly verifies the `repetition_penalty` mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Simulated Generated Tokens**: `simulated_generated_tokens = torch.tensor([[10, 20, 10, 30]])` creates a mock sequence of previously generated tokens, where token `10` and `20` appear.\n",
        "2.  **Raw Logits Creation**: `raw_logits = torch.randn(1, model.config.vocab_size)` generates random raw logits. Specific high logits are assigned to token `10` (repeated), `20` (repeated), and `40` (new/non-repeated) to clearly observe the penalty effect.\n",
        "3.  **Repetition Penalty Application**: A new `LogitsProcessor` instance `processor_rp` is created with `repetition_penalty=2.0`. It then processes the `raw_logits` using `simulated_generated_tokens`.\n",
