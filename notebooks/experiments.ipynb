        "Scaled Dot-Product Attention is a fundamental component of the Transformer architecture, designed to efficiently compute attention weights. It takes three inputs: a query matrix (Q), a key matrix (K), and a value matrix (V). The core idea is to calculate a similarity score between the queries and keys, scale these scores, and then use them to weigh the values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Description:**\n",

This scaling factor is crucial for preventing the dot products from becoming too large, especially with high `d_k` values, which can push the softmax function into regions with extremely small gradients, hindering training.\n",
        "3.  **Masking (Optional):** If a mask is provided, typically for causality (to prevent attention to future tokens in sequence generation) or padding (to ignore non-existent tokens), the masked positions are set to a very small negative number (e.g., `-inf`). This ensures that after the softmax operation, these positions will have an attention weight of approximately zero.\n",
        "4.  **Softmax:** A softmax function is applied to the scaled scores to obtain attention weights. This normalizes the scores such that they sum to 1, representing a probability distribution over the values.\n",
        "5.  **Weighted Sum:** Finally, these attention weights are multiplied by the value matrix (V). This creates a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is determined by its relevance to the query.\n",

It extends the concept of `ScaledDotProductAttention` by ensuring that during sequence generation, each token can only attend to previous tokens and itself, not future tokens. This is vital for tasks like language modeling where predicting the next word depends only on the words that have already occurred.\n",

        "    *   `self.scale`: A scaling factor `1 / sqrt(head_dim)` is calculated, which is standard for scaled dot-product attention to prevent large dot products from pushing the softmax into regions with tiny gradients.\n",
        "    *   `self.qkv_proj`: A linear projection layer that transforms the input `x` (with shape `(B, T, D)`) into Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) matrices. It outputs `3 * d_model` dimensions, which are then split into `d_model` for Q, K, and V respectively.\n",
        "    *   `self.out_proj`: Another linear projection layer that takes the concatenated output from all attention heads and projects it back to the original `d_model` dimension.\n",
        "    *   `self.causal_mask`: A lower triangular matrix (e.g., `[[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]]`) is created. This mask is used to block attention to future tokens. It's registered as a buffer, meaning it's part of the model's state but not a trainable parameter.\n",

        "### KVCache and CachedCausalSelfAttention: Optimizing Inference with KV Caching\n",
        "\n",
        "To enhance the efficiency of autoregressive decoding in Transformer models, especially during inference, Key-Value (KV) caching is employed. This technique avoids redundant re-computation of keys and values for previously processed tokens, significantly speeding up generation. The `KVCache` class manages this storage, and `CachedCausalSelfAttention` utilizes it for incremental token processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. `KVCache` Class\n",
        "\n",
        "The `KVCache` class is a simple container designed to store the keys (K) and values (V) computed during the self-attention mechanism across multiple decoding steps. This cache allows subsequent tokens to attend to the full historical context without re-calculating the K and V matrices for past tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Operational Breakdown:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`__init__(self)`**: Initializes an empty cache by setting `self.keys` and `self.values` to `None`. This state indicates that no keys or values have been stored yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`append(self, k_new: torch.Tensor, v_new: torch.Tensor)`**: This method adds new key and value tensors to the cache. It expects `k_new` and `v_new` to have the shape `(B, H, 1, Dh)`, representing the keys and values for the current token across batches and attention heads.\n",
        "    *   If the cache is empty (`self.keys` is `None`), the new keys and values become the initial content of the cache.\n",
        "    *   If the cache already contains data, `k_new` and `v_new` are concatenated with the existing `self.keys` and `self.values` along the sequence length dimension (dimension 2). This effectively appends the current token's K and V to the historical sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`reset(self)`**: Clears the cache by setting `self.keys` and `self.values` back to `None`. This is typically used to prepare the cache for a new generation sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. `CachedCausalSelfAttention` Class\n",
        "\n",
        "The `CachedCausalSelfAttention` module is a specialized version of the `CausalSelfAttention` designed for efficient token-by-token generation (inference) by leveraging the `KVCache`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Differences from `CausalSelfAttention`:**\n",
        "*   It processes input `x_t` with a sequence length `T=1` (a single token at a time).\n",
        "*   It takes a `kv_cache` object as an argument to store and retrieve past keys and values.\n",
        "*   It *implicitly* handles causality by only attending to the `k_full` and `v_full` retrieved from the cache, which by its nature only contains past and current tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Operational Breakdown (`forward` method):**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Input**: `x_t` with shape `(B, 1, D)` (a single token per batch) and `kv_cache`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Assertion**: `assert T == 1, \"Cached attention expects exactly one token\"` ensures that the module is used for incremental decoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **QKV Projections**: Similar to `CausalSelfAttention`, `x_t` is projected into query `q`, key `k`, and value `v` tensors for the *current* token.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Multi-Head Reshaping**: `q`, `k`, and `v` are reshaped to `(B, n_heads, 1, head_dim)` to prepare for multi-head attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Cache Append**: The newly computed `k` and `v` for the current token are appended to the `kv_cache` using `kv_cache.append(k, v)`. The cache now holds the keys and values for *all* tokens processed so far in the current sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Retrieve Full Cache**: The complete historical `keys` (`k_full`) and `values` (`v_full`) are retrieved from the `kv_cache`. These tensors will have shape `(B, H, T_total, Dh)`, where `T_total` is the current length of the generated sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Attention Score Calculation**: The query `q` (current token's query) is used to compute attention scores against `k_full` (all past and current keys). This ensures that the current token attends to the entire context generated so far.\n",
        "    $$\\text{scores} = (Q_{\\text{current}} K_{\\text{full}}^T) / \\sqrt{d_k}$$\n",
        "    The `scores` tensor will have shape `(B, n_heads, 1, T_total)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Softmax and Weighted Sum**: `softmax` is applied to the scores, and the resulting attention weights are multiplied by `v_full` to produce the output `out` for the current token. This `out` tensor effectively summarizes the information from `v_full` relevant to the current `q`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Merge Heads and Output Projection**: The `out` tensor is reshaped back to `(B, 1, D)` and then passed through `self.out_proj` to yield the final output for the current token.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Mathematical Intuition for Cached Self-Attention:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The core attention computation within `CachedCausalSelfAttention` can be viewed as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\text{Attention}(\\text{token}_t) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q_t \\cdot K_{\\le t}^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) \\cdot V_{\\le t} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "*   $Q_t$ is the Query vector for the current token at position $t$.\n",
        "*   $K_{\\le t}$ represents the concatenated Key matrix containing keys for all tokens from position $1$ up to $t$ (retrieved from `kv_cache.keys`).\n",
        "*   $V_{\\le t}$ represents the concatenated Value matrix containing values for all tokens from position $1$ up to $t$ (retrieved from `kv_cache.values`).\n",
        "*   $d_k$ is the `head_dim`, the dimensionality of the key vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this formulation, the causal masking that explicitly masks future tokens in `CausalSelfAttention` is implicitly handled. By only storing and using keys and values from tokens up to the current position ($K_{\\le t}$ and $V_{\\le t}$), the model naturally prevents attending to future information. The KV cache makes this process highly efficient by avoiding re-computation of $K_{\\le t}$ and $V_{\\le t}$ at each step; instead, it simply appends the new $K_t$ and $V_t$ to the existing cache."

        "This function implements Top-P sampling, also known as Nucleus Sampling. This method selects the smallest set of most probable tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds a threshold `p`, and then redistributes the probability mass among only these selected tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "1.  `sorted_probs, sorted_indices = torch.sort(probs, descending=True, dim=-1)`: Sorts the probabilities in descending order and keeps track of their original indices.\n",
        "2.  `cumulative_probs = torch.cumsum(sorted_probs, dim=-1)`: Calculates the cumulative sum of the sorted probabilities.\n",
        "3.  `mask = cumulative_probs <= p` and `mask[..., 0] = True`: Creates a boolean mask. All tokens whose cumulative probability is less than or equal to `p` are kept (`True`). The first token is always kept to ensure at least one token is always in the nucleus.\n",
        "4.  `filtered_sorted_probs = torch.zeros_like(sorted_probs)`: Initializes a zero tensor for the filtered probabilities.\n",
        "5.  `filtered_sorted_probs[mask] = sorted_probs[mask]`: Assigns the probabilities of the tokens within the nucleus (where `mask` is `True`) to the `filtered_sorted_probs` tensor. All others remain zero.\n",
        "6.  `result_probs.scatter_(dim=-1, index=sorted_indices, src=filtered_sorted_probs)`: Reconstructs the probability distribution in the original token order, placing the filtered probabilities back into their correct positions.\n",
        "7.  `return result_probs / result_probs.sum(dim=-1, keepdim=True)`: Renormalizes the probabilities within the nucleus so they sum to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Effect:** Top-P sampling dynamically adjusts the effective vocabulary size based on the shape of the probability distribution. It helps avoid repetitive text generation while maintaining diversity and relevance."

        "1.  **Cache Reset:** `model.reset_cache()` ensures a clean state for each new generation sequence.\n",
        "2.  **Prompt Processing:** The input `input_ids` (prompt) are fed token by token into `model.forward_step()` to build up the KV cache without generating new tokens.\n",
        "3.  **Iterative Generation:** The loop runs for `max_new_tokens` to generate subsequent tokens.\n",
        "4.  **Greedy Sampling (`temperature = 0.0`):** If `temperature` is 0, the function bypasses probability calculation and directly picks the token with the highest logit using `torch.argmax`. This results in deterministic, greedy generation.\n",
        "5.  **Temperature Scaling:** For `temperature > 0.0`, `logits` are divided by `temperature` before `softmax`. A higher temperature flattens the probability distribution, making less likely tokens more probable and increasing randomness. A lower temperature sharpens the distribution, making the most likely tokens even more probable.\n",
        "6.  **Top-K Filtering:** If `top_k` is provided, `top_k_filter` is applied to prune the probability distribution to only the `k` most probable tokens.\n",
        "7.  **Top-P Filtering:** If `top_p` is provided, `top_p_filter` is applied to select the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds `p`.\n",
        "8.  **Token Sampling:** `torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1)` samples a new token based on the (optionally filtered and temperature-scaled) probability distribution.\n",
        "9.  **Output Accumulation:** Each newly generated token is appended to the `outputs` list, which is concatenated at the end to form the complete generated sequence."
