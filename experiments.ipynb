        "Scaled Dot-Product Attention is a fundamental component of the Transformer architecture, designed to efficiently compute attention weights. It takes three inputs: a query matrix (Q), a key matrix (K), and a value matrix (V). The core idea is to calculate a similarity score between the queries and keys, scale these scores, and then use them to weigh the values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Description:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Similarity Calculation:** The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the query and key matrices. This measures how relevant each key is to each query.\n",
        "2.  **Scaling:** The scores are then divided by the square root of the dimension of the keys (`d_k`). This scaling factor is crucial for preventing the dot products from becoming too large, especially with high `d_k` values, which can push the softmax function into regions with extremely small gradients, hindering training.\n",
        "3.  **Masking (Optional):** If a mask is provided, typically for causality (to prevent attention to future tokens in sequence generation) or padding (to ignore non-existent tokens), the masked positions are set to a very small negative number (e.g., `-inf`). This ensures that after the softmax operation, these positions will have an attention weight of approximately zero.\n",
        "4.  **Softmax:** A softmax function is applied to the scaled scores to obtain attention weights. This normalizes the scores such that they sum to 1, representing a probability distribution over the values.\n",
        "5.  **Weighted Sum:** Finally, these attention weights are multiplied by the value matrix (V). This creates a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is determined by its relevance to the query.\n",

It extends the concept of `ScaledDotProductAttention` by ensuring that during sequence generation, each token can only attend to previous tokens and itself, not future tokens. This is vital for tasks like language modeling where predicting the next word depends only on the words that have already occurred.\n",

        "1.  **Initialization (`__init__`)**:\n",
        "    *   It takes a `ModelConfig` object, which defines parameters like the number of attention heads (`n_heads`), the dimensionality of each head (`head_dim`), and the model's total dimension (`d_model`).\n",
        "    *   `self.scale`: A scaling factor `1 / sqrt(head_dim)` is calculated, which is standard for scaled dot-product attention to prevent large dot products from pushing the softmax into regions with tiny gradients.\n",
        "    *   `self.qkv_proj`: A linear projection layer that transforms the input `x` (with shape `(B, T, D)`) into Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) matrices. It outputs `3 * d_model` dimensions, which are then split into `d_model` for Q, K, and V respectively.\n",
        "    *   `self.out_proj`: Another linear projection layer that takes the concatenated output from all attention heads and projects it back to the original `d_model` dimension.\n",
        "    *   `self.causal_mask`: A lower triangular matrix (e.g., `[[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]]`) is created. This mask is used to block attention to future tokens. It's registered as a buffer, meaning it's part of the model's state but not a trainable parameter.\n",

        "    *   **Multi-Head Reshaping**: Each `q`, `k`, and `v` tensor is reshaped to `(B, n_heads, T, head_dim)`. This involves splitting the `d_model` dimension into `n_heads` separate heads, each with `head_dim` dimensions.

This means that after the softmax, these future positions will have an attention weight of zero, effectively preventing a token from attending to future tokens.\n",
